ROS-PID

The ROSbot robot is placed in an unstructured simulated environment. You are asked to
do the following (100%):
1) Implement a PID Controller that enacts a right edge following behaviour
(20%).
2) Implement a fuzzy logic controller that can enact (50%):
    i. Right edge following behaviour (25%).
    ii. Obstacle avoidance behaviour (25%).
3) Integrate the aforementioned behaviours into a single fuzzy logic control
architecture (10%).
The remaining 20% of the marks will be awarded for the quality of your code
